# Weather_App

# Description
Here is my app! This weather app gives you the daily and weekly forecast for any city that you search. The application features the Open Weather API which stores all of the data needed to gather the most updated weather conditions for any city. I uttlize the moments.js API to capture the current date as well as the dates for the next five days. You will not need to worry about adding to search your cities everytime you use the app as the app will store your most recent search, so you can come back and check the current weather whenever you need. This project showcases my skill and knowledge in applying API's, JQuery, and Bootstrap.
